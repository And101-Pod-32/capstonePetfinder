## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Petfinder App
    - **Description**: An app that allows users to search nearby pets up for adoption by type (cat, dog, etc), age, traits (good with other dogs, children, etc), breed, etc
    - **Mobile**: Not a uniquely mobile experience, similar to website
    - **Story**: Users can browse what pets are up for adoption near them with the added convenience of looking the information whenever they want from their mobile device
    - **Market**: For anyone who has a mobile device and is looking for an animal companion
    - **Habit**: A user will probably use the app more frequently if they are looking for a pet and users will only consume information on the app 
    - **Scope**: The application is a directory of pets users can scroll through in a recycler view to find a pet they're interested in

2. Movie Search App
    - **Description**: Allows users to search for films based on different criteria, such as title, directors, actors and year of relese. The app displays movie posters and other information. Users can then mark films as watched or add them to their watchlist.
    - **Mobile**: The app would make it easier for users to log their films.
    - **Story**: Users interested in film are able to search quickly for new movies to watch and log their favorite films easily.
    - **Market**: The market is large as it appeals to any person who is interested in watching a film and has a smart phone.
    - **Habit**: A user would probably use it any time they want to watch a film, which would mostly be on the weekends, summer, or over the holidays.
    - **Scope**: The app is manageable as it does not require too much information and detail.

3. Recipe Finder App
    - **Description**: Allows user to find recipies based on their favorite type of cuisine category or with a "I'm feeling lucky" random category selector.
    - **Mobile**: The app would be mobile-first. While it would have similar functionalities to a hypothetical website, the app would make much greater use of its allocated screen real estate.
    - **Story**: Users can find unique foods and explore new food styles from around the world.
    - **Market**: The app would appeal to young adults that regularly try out new experiences.
    - **Habit**: The app will likely not be frequently used. It will be pulled out when the user needs to find a new recipie, which may not be that often.
    - **Scope**: The app is realistic and does not require too much information or complexity.
